The "_internal" directory is required for Panel Cleaner to run.

This used to be compressed inside of the PanelCleaner.exe file,
whereupon running Panel Cleaner it would first spend several seconds
uncompressing the directory to a temporary location, wasting a lot of time.

In short, always keep it in the same directory as the PanelCleaner.exe.
